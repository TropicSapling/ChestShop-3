ChestShop
================================

ChestShop is an awesome plugin for managing your server's economy. 
By using chests and signs, you can effectively create your own market!

*This fork is my attempt at adding refunding & updating to the latest stable Minecraft version.*

Building
--------------------------------

#### Installing

To build ChestShop, you'll need a Maven installation.
* [Maven download](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Launch `mvn clean install` -- that's it!

#### Installing external dependencies

To install external dependencies, place your .jar into the main folder and launch the `install_dependency_to_repo.sh` script - it'll guide you through the process.
